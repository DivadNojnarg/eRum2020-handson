- Class: text
  Output: The R6 package provides an implementation of encapsulated object-oriented programming (OOP) for R.

- Class: text
  Output: R6 classes are similar to R’s reference classes, but are lighter weight, and avoid some issues that come along with using S4 (R’s reference classes are based on S4). 
    For more information about speed and memory footprint, see the Performance article (https://r6.r-lib.org/articles/Performance.html).

- Class: text
  Output: Unlike many objects in R, instances (objects) of R6 classes have reference semantics.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Print on the console the Person R6 Class.
  CorrectAnswer: Person
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Person')
  Hint: The Person class is already loaded, type ls() to see it.

- Class: text
  Output: You have just printed the Class definition as show on the slide. There are two fields and three methods defined. 
    Note that the clone function is provided by R6.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Create a person with black hair named Steve and save the reference of the person in a variable p.
  CorrectAnswer: p <- Person$new(name = "Steve",hair = "black")
  AnswerTests: expr_creates_var('p');any_of_exprs('p <- Person$new(name = "Steve",hair = "black")','p <- Person$new("Steve","black")')
  Hint: Use Person$new(...) to create a new person and don't forget to assign it to p.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Print the p object on the console and notice the difference with the Class Person.
  CorrectAnswer: p
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='p')
  Hint: Just type p....

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Now make Steve's hair orange.
  CorrectAnswer: p$set_hair("orange")
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='p$set_hair("orange")')
  Hint: Use the set_hair method. Note that code completion is available, just type p$....

- Class: text
  Output: It is now time for {tidymodules}...
  
- Class: text
  Output: tidymodules or tm in short uses R6 Classes...

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Print on the console the parent Class of all {tm} modules
  CorrectAnswer: TidyModule
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='TidyModule')
  Hint: It has the same name as the package

- Class: text
  Output: That's a big Class with a lot of cool things! Now let's make a counter with {tm}...
