```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Examples below are powered by the [`{js4shiny}`](https://pkg.js4shiny.com/index.html) package by Garrick Aden-Buie! It allows to run JS code in an rmarkdown document without the need of Node.

## Exercise 1: define variables (2 minutes)

1. Play with the example below.

```{js}
let myNumber = 1; // affectation
myNumber--; // decrement
console.log(myNumber); // print 0
```

## Exercise 2: define objects (5 minutes)

Below is an object skeleton.

```{js}
const me = {
  name : ,
  age : ,
  music : ,
  printName: function() {
    console.log(`I am ${}`);
  }
}
```

1. Fill it with some random values.
2. Access the name property.
3. Create the printAge method, which returns the age. Hint: `this` refers to the object itself. For instance `this.name` gives the name property.
